<h1 style="text-align:center;">Abelana Privacy Policy</h1>
Abelana is a set of demonstration application(s) used for educational purposes.  The applications collect your
name, email, and possibly a photograph of you from your ID provider.  Currently, we keep this
information -- however, our intention is to allow you to delete all of your data. (It's just not
implemented yet).
</br></br>
If you choose to upload a photograph, it is shared with your "followers".  This sharing
will include your full name.  You do not get to choose your followers, so everyone may see this.
</br></br>
If you follow someone, they can see your name.  If you get followed by someone, they will also see
your name.</br></br>

Lastly, we keep log files for 30 days.  This includes every api call that the application(s) may
make on your belhalf.  The only current purpose this has is for us to determine the reliability of
the application.
</br></br>
We do not share your information with anyone except as noted above.
